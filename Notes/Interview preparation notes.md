I vs We: 
Using WE is good when talking about a team, but on client interviews it is preferable to use I and point out, how outstanding and cool I was during my projects
On one hand I can use "We" to point out I can work in a team, on the other hand, I need to show-off my achievements and my performance.

Show off: 
Instead of saying "the client was happy" or "I delivered on time", say that "We delivered early", or "It helped to save money"

Don't tell names.
Use placeholders. BAD: I worked on Decusoft; GOOD: I worked with a known fin-tech client ...

Tell us about yourself: [Don't go through the CV, interviewer have it and will ask you if needed.] 

Hello, my name is Alex. I am a fullstack software developer. I have been working for about <experience> years. During that time I've completed 4 projects on 4 different clients.
Before I came up working with front-end and React 3 years ago, I started my career as a backend developer working with .NET framework and .NET Core.
My current tech stack includes such technologies as .NET, React, Angular, SQL databases and MongoDB.
I'm also very passionate about Web apps of different kinds. So in my spare time I am building small apps with different technologies just to try different approaches 
and find some better ways of building web solutions.

Important: I have to expand my answer to talk about my experience. But not too much to be specific and concentrate on the question.
Example: Have you worked with [tech] -- Yes, I have been working with this tech for ... Do you want to hear about a project, where I was using it?
