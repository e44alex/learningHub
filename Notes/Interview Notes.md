1. Decusoft
	- Developed some advanced features in legacy app versions on ASP.NET MVC (Net Frame 4.7.1)
	- With team migrated application to .NET Core 3.1 on SOA, then re-created from scratch on .NET Core 6 + MongoDB. Wath involved both in tasks on front-end and backend
	- Parcticipated in developing of custom expression engine
	- Developed high-performant audit service
	- Bugfixing, system stability improvements, usability testing and application immersion
2. Bars web reports
	- Was involved in close knit work with busines analysist, requirements gathering, usability analysis, user testing, etc.
	- Redesigned and refactored existing codebase
	- Developed data integration into 3rd party system
	- Developed a set of reusable components to simplify and speed up further development

3. Medical Device Inventory managing

	- created 

4. SMG

4 years of experience. Working as full-stack .NET developer

- Decusoft is interesting because 
	- for the last 3 years we came the process of commiting to legacy application to migrating it to SOA, .NET Core stack, Azure and React; After that we created the same application, but with a brand new philosophy of zero code.
	- it is multitenant, which make it a little bit harder to develop, but on the other side interesting. It is easy to connect a new tenant and see how project grows.
	- latest version has MongoDB running on Atlas and it was an exciting experience to do a research, compare with Azure CosmosDB, 


Things to keep in mind: 
	- Processes: We had some cut-off version of scrum, but in tendency of high development tempo and 


Most challenging tasks: 
	- Audit. Really challenging task to create a resilent and high performant service, most challenging to keep it working with ustable Mongo ChangeStream.
	- Expression engine. Was challenging to learn new Antlr technology, invent easy-maintainable way to organize and manage expression grammar parsers and validator, 
	make it hight performant on execute time and keep grammar parsers for both FE and BE. 
	Finished up using ANTLR, own expression processing code, which pre-compiles and cached C# Expression trees, and then use it during calculations. 
	- Client customizable front-ends
